          Our services present a cost savings to your company between 30 to 50% by administering on-site testing as opposed to sending employees to an off-site facility. Reduction in "lost time" and liability for travel, combined with the ability to conduct four tests simultaneously &ndash; a rate of twelve employees per hour, makes on-site hearing tests an enormously economical, safe, and wise choice for your company.
